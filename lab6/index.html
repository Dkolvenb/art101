		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This lab was definitely harder than the previous labs in that it required more of an understanding of more complex coding.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I ran into an issue where my .js file was not showing up on my website when I viewed it in browser. It took some time to figure out the issue, but it ended up being a small mis-step in forgetting a comma.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>This website is the result of my efforts and below is the JavaScript output from the .js file.</p>
			<h2>Script Output</h2>
			<div class=output>
