  	<h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
  	<h2>Challenges</h2>
    		<p>The major challenge for this lab was getting the right commands into JavaScript. Using the console in browser helped pinpoint what the problems were.</p>
  	<h2>Problems</h2>
    		<p>No problems outside of the overarching challenges.</p>
  	<h2>Results</h2>
    		<p>Below are the results of my efforts. The text is created by creating elements and linking those elements to eachother and then linking it all up to the html page via a div. Pretty neat stuff.</p>
			<h2>Output</h2>
