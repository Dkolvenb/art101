<h4>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h4>
	<h1>Everyday Tasks</h1>
<div id="task1">
	<h3>How to make a soft boiled egg.</h3>
		<p>Get a pot, skimmer, desired number of eggs, A medium sized bowl (should be able to fit the eggs inside), and ice</p>
		<p>Fill your pot with water and place on a stove until the water is boiling</p>
		<p>Turn the heat slightly down while placing the eggs gently into the pot</p>
		<p>Turn the heat back up</p>
		<p>Cook for around 6 min</p>
		<p>Prepare an ice bath during this time by filling the bowl with water and ice up to about 3/4</p>
	  <p>Remove the eggs from the water using your skimmer</p>
		<p>Place them in a the ice bath to stop them from cooking further</p>
		<p>Peel the shell and enjoy</p>
</div>
<div id="task2">
	<h3>How to change a car’s oil.</h3>
		<p>Make sure you have the right tools for the process</p>
		<p>Look up your car’s oil capacity (usually in quarts)</p>
		<p>Purchase any tools you are missing along with preferred oil rating and correct oil filter</p>
		<p>Park car on a level surface and let cool for an hour</p>
		<p>Find your car’s oil sump and unscrew the plug</p>
		<p>Once drained, unscrew the oil filter and let drain</p>
		<p>Wipe areas around plug insert and filter insert with a rag</p>
		<p>Screw in sump plug. Lubricate the “O” ring on filter and screw into its spot</p>
		<p>Locate the oil sump cap on top of the engine bay and begin filling with oil</p>
		<p>Replace cap and let the car run for about five minutes</p>
</div>
<div id="task3">
	<h3>How to make rice without a rice cooker.</h3>
		<p>Get a pot that will hold preferred amount of rice and water</p>
		<p>Measure amount of rice desired</p>
		<p>Wash rice under cold water, once for stickier rice, or more for less-sticky rice</p>
		<p>Place the rice in the pot under ~2inches of water</p>
		<p>Let the rice soak for about 15-20 min with the lid on</p>
		<p>Boil the rice at high temperature for 12-15 min</p>
		<p>Remove from heat and let sit for 15-20 minutes</p>
		<p>Remove the lid and enjoy the yummy yummy rice in your tummy</p>

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<div id="cpr">
	<p>
		This lab didn't pose much of a challenge outside of learning the language for JavaScript and getting used to how it looks. I had to ask Benjamin for help when creating the pseudocode as I did not understand the meaning of the indents for the script. I figured that it might be an operations order and Benjamin explained that that is pretty much what it is.

<h5>Problems</h5>
	<div id="cpr">
		<p>
			Since this lab did not pose much of a challenge, I luckily did not run into any problems while completing it.

<h5>Results</h5>

			This page is the culmination of effort put into the two previous labs and some more exploration using the style sheet to customize my website. I think using the analogy of everyday tasks and breaking them up into sub-tasks helped me understand the basics of JavaScript really well. This excersize in teh lab really solidified that for me as well. As seen in the first section, Ben and I came up with three everyday tasks that may not be everyday for some people. Ben chose how to make a soft-boiled egg. I came up with how to change the oil of your car, which I figured out later was more tedious to write out than expected. Then, Ben and I came to the conclusion that not everyone knows how to cook rice without a rice cooker, so we made a task list on that as well.
