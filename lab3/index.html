	<h2>Subject</h2>
		<p>This lab holds the purpose of showing us how to link sibling files together. This allows us to click on an in-browser link to access those files and view them instantly as opposed to opening a separate window. This lab also demonstartes the importance of having your files in the right place so each web page works as intended with the correct style and content.
		</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The main challenge I faced when completing this lab was setting up the CSS file to stylize my webpage.

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>What you are looking at is the result of my efforts. Below is an image of the file structure I used organize my projects to be able to link them up easily and work on them without getting lost. (Thanks Wes for the premade structure!)
