	<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was pretty easy with help from the instructions on Canvas. The only challenge was completing the bonus tasks where we add more functions to the code. I couldn't figure out how to shuffle the input name to create a strange one. All online tutorials dealt in numbers rather than letters.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>No problems arose in this lab aside from the afromentioned challenge.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>This webpage is the result of my efforts. Below is your full name rearranged in alphabetical order with capital letters being listed first.</p>
