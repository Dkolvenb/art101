			<h2>Challenges</h2>
      		<p>This lab was again, pretty easy. We troubleshooted some small issues but were able to correct things and have the website look nice along with having the JavaScript code work. The main challenge was completing Task X which I decided not to do. It was pretty complex and I couldn't figure it out.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      		<p>No problems while doing the lab.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      		<p>This page is the result of my efforts, please open the inspect tool to see what mt JavaScript is doing in the background.</p>
